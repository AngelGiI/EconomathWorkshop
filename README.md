**Economathematics Workshop**

This repository contains work completed during the *Taller de Economatem√°ticas* course, which focused on modeling and solving complex optimization problems in socio-economic and industrial contexts. The course emphasized mathematical programming techniques, including deterministic and stochastic modeling, with applications in logistics, humanitarian aid, and energy systems.

### Overview:
- **Core Topics:**
  - Mathematical programming and optimization.
  - Deterministic and stochastic models.
  - Multi-criteria decision-making.
  - Practical implementation with GAMS software.
  - Applications in logistics and energy planning.

- **Highlighted Projects:**
  1. **Humanitarian Logistics in Niger:**  
     Developed an optimization model to address a food and health crisis in Niger. The project involved:
     - Designing distribution networks for humanitarian aid.
     - Optimizing the location of distribution centers under budget and distance constraints.
     - Solving multi-objective problems to balance cost, equity, and unmet demand.
     - Implementing Pareto frontiers and goal programming techniques to support decision-making.
  
  2. **Energy Generation Planning:**  
     Created deterministic and stochastic models for optimal electricity generation. Key features:
     - Balancing energy demand and production using thermal and hydroelectric plants.
     - Incorporating technical constraints, such as ramp-up/down rates, start-up/shut-down costs, and reservoir management.
     - Minimizing production costs while ensuring system reliability.
     - Exploring uncertainties in energy demand through scenario analysis.

This repository demonstrates the practical application of mathematical programming to real-world problems, with a focus on balancing multiple objectives and integrating theoretical concepts with computational tools.
